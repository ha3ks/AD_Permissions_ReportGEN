# AD_Permissions_ReportGEN

A PowerShell script that *should* give you a list of users and permissions in a .csv that didn't cost $1B.

This is mainly put up as a joke and to prove a point when it comes to calling names and bullying/belittleing security researchers. However this also reminds me of the content covered in Heath Adams Windows Privelage Escalation Course, you should check it out sometime if you are working with Active Directory as it can give you a new perspective on things.

Installation:
Download script
Edit the output file/directory as needed.
Run Script and then check your output .csv.

Should be good to go but in honesty I can't test and confirm it as my Laptop lab would catch fire and explode (It's not a super laptop but it does the trick till I can afford something that would let me play around with AD better).

If you see any issues please feel free to submit pull requests, bug reports or even shout out on twitter. I am always happy to learn from someone who knows better then me.

Peace.
